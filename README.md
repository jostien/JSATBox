JSATBox - Java SAT Toolbox
--------------------------

JSATBox is a small, incomplete Java SAT Toolbox. It contains classes for handling
constraints conveniently. See examples.

Will heavily be extended in future to other problem instances like LP, ILP and MILP.

Requirements
------------

Some SAT solver is needed, which is to be placed to an analogous location as
indicated in the example files. That is, exchange

<path_to_minisat>

and

<path_to_result_dir>

correspondingly. A good starting point is MiniSAT:
